# Project Rules

## Backend (Node/Express/Mongo)
- **Architecture:** Strictly follow the Controller-Service-Repository pattern.
  - Controllers: Handle HTTP requests/responses ONLY.
  - Services: Handle business logic and DB calls.
- **Database:** Use Mongoose Aggregation Pipelines for all complex queries (Search, Filter, Sort).
- **Error Handling:** Use async/await with try-catch blocks in Controllers.
- **Response Format:** All endpoints must return JSON: `{ success: boolean, data: any, message: string }`.

## Frontend (React/Vite/Shadcn)
- **UI Components:** Use Shadcn/UI patterns (Radix primitives + Tailwind).
- **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS utility classes. NO inline styles.
- **State Management:**
  - LIFT STATE TO URL. Use `useSearchParams` for filtering, sorting, and pagination.
  - Do NOT use local state (`useState`) for page filters.
- **Networking:** Use a centralized Axios instance with interceptors.
